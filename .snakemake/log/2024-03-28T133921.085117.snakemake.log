MissingOutputException in rule fastqc in file /home/odette/stage-two/workflow/rules/fastqc.smk, line 28:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R2.zip (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R2.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R1.zip (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R1.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job fastqc since they might be corrupted:
results/fastqc_output
Skipped removing non-empty directory results/fastqc_output
Shutting down, this might take some time.
