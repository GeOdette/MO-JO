MissingOutputException in rule fastqc in file /home/odette/stage-two/workflow/rules/fastqc.smk, line 27:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R2_fastqc.zip (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R2_fastqc.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R1_fastqc.zip (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
results/fastqc_out/ACBarrie_R1_fastqc.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job fastqc since they might be corrupted:
results/fastqc_output
Skipped removing non-empty directory results/fastqc_output
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
